                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and 
                   other physical and mental impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields. Medicine, dentistry, 
                   pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions
                   all constitute health care. The term includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.
                    Access to healthcare may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as
                  health policies. Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health
                  outcomes".[3] Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations (such as insurance coverage), geographical
                  and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the ability to take paid time off work to use such services),
                  sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, 
                  low income).[4] Limitations to health care services affect negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and 
                  overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).

                    Health systems are the organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations. According to the World Health
                     Organization (WHO), a well-functioning healthcare system requires a financing mechanism, a well-trained and adequately paid workforce,
                      reliable information on which to base decisions and policies, and well-maintained health facilities to deliver quality medicines and 
                      technologies.

                    An efficient healthcare system can contribute to a significant part of a country's economy, development, and industrialization. Health
                     care is an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world.[5] An
                     example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO, as the first disease in human history to be 
                     eliminated by deliberate healthcare interventions.
